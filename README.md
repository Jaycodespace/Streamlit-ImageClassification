# AutoClassify 

AutoClassify is a car image classification mini-project powered by deep learning. Using a ResNet-50 architecture and the Stanford Cars Dataset, this project aims to accurately identify and categorize various car models from images.

## Project Overview

AutoClassify uses transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to classify car images into their corresponding make and model. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the field of image recognition and automotive applications.
